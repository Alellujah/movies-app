# App made with React, Typescript, Redux, Epics

**Search movies through MovieDbAPI**

npm install & npm start

### To improve:
 - [ ] Improve visual 
 - [ ] Write tests
 - [ ] Present results on the table in incoming order, it's not appearing because I'm mapping id to obj keys when I receive the results
 - [x] Check if there are more results available in epic after getting more movies from the list (just needed to use total_pages from api...)
